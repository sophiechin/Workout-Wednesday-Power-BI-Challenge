# WOW2022 Week 40 | Power BI: Field Parameters with Conditional Formatting

## Problem Statement
This Workout Wednesday Week 40 challenge involves the **Field Parameter** in Power BI which is the feature that allows users to select what fields they are using in visuals via a report slicer

The participants in this week's challenge are asked to enhance the report from [WOW2022 Week 21](https://workout-wednesday.com/pbi-2022-w21/) by introducing an additional parameter and implementing conditional formatting in the report. This improvement will add depth and interactivity to the visualization, making it more insightful and appealing to the audience.



## Challenge Requirement

- Activate the preview option, Field Parameters.
- Establish a measure named "Total Sales".
- Develop a new field parameter incorporating Total Sales and Margin %.
- Integrate the parameter field slicer into the report, enabling a single selection.
- Adapt existing visuals to utilize the newly defined parameters.
- Construct a matrix table and apply conditional formatting to each measure.
